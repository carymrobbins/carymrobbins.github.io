        Welcome to my rantings about software development and whatever else I feel like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that even though said rantings may appear as advice, it's very possible that
        you should never take any of it very seriously.  Anything you may encounter is not a
        reflection of my employer, friends, family, or otherwise any possible or potential reality.
