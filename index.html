  <h1>Yo!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my rantings about software development and whatever else I feel like.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that even though said rantings may appear as advice, it's very possible that
    you should never take any of it very seriously.  Anything you may encounter is not a
    reflection of my employer, friends, family, or otherwise any possible or potential reality.
